# Marketing Campaign Analysis: Control vs. Test Group

## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the effectiveness of two marketing campaigns — a **control** group and a **test** group — to determine which one delivered better performance.

I was tasked with evaluating the success of these campaigns using a combination of **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **statistical testing**. The main objective was to assess whether the test campaign produced a statistically significant improvement over the control.

## 🔍 Methodology

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial visual and statistical summaries were used to understand the structure and behavior of both groups.
- **Two-sample t-test**: A statistical t-test was performed to compare the **conversion rates** between the control and test groups and validate whether the difference was significant.
- **KPI Calculation – ROI**: 
  - Since actual revenue per conversion wasn't available, a hypothetical value was assumed to estimate revenue and calculate **Return on Investment (ROI)**.
  - ROI was derived using reach, conversion rate, spend, and assumed conversion value.
  - This provided a more holistic view of each campaign's efficiency beyond conversion rate alone.

## ✅ Results

The analysis demonstrated that:
- The **test group had a statistically higher conversion rate** than the control group.
- However, when evaluating **ROI**, the test group did not necessarily outperform the control group, due to differences in reach and spend.
- These combined insights provided a more nuanced picture of campaign performance and helped identify the more effective marketing strategy.
